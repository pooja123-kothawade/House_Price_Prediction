# üè° House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models using Python.

---

üìå ## 1. Overview

The aim of this project is to create a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on historical housing data. It covers:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection and engineering
* Model training, evaluation, and comparison
* Price prediction for new data points

---

## 2. Dataset

The dataset contains information about various houses and their sale prices.
It includes features such as:

* **Lot area**
* **Number of bedrooms**
* **Bathrooms**
* **Location**
* **Year built**
* **Sale price**

---

## 3. Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
* **Scikit-learn**

## 4. Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pooja123-kothawade/House_Price_Prediction.git
   cd House_Price_Prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

---

## 5. Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the notebook file (`house_price_prediction.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells step-by-step to:

   * Preprocess the dataset
   * Train and evaluate models
   * Predict house prices for new inputs

## 6. Tips

* Switch between **Notebook View** and **Text Editor View** in VS Code by right-clicking the file tab ‚Üí **Open With**.
* Use virtual environments to keep dependencies organized.

---

## 7. Results

* The final model achieved **X% accuracy** (replace with actual result).
* Model performance was evaluated using metrics like:

  * R¬≤ Score
  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
